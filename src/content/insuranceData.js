    We are working hard to make it happen, but until then, we recommend all our Hosts to purchase a Trailer Rental Insurance 
    policy separately before offering their trailer for rent. We understand that this is inconvenient, so we're offering to pay the insurance
    premium or $30 (whichever is lower) of all of our Texas hosts for every month their trailer goes unrented. Contact insurance@trailerhub.io
    with proof of your insurance policy to get started.`;
