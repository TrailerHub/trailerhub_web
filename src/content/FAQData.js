In the message box explain what the problem is and any other relevant information that we should know. After submitting the dispute we recommend you call our support team, but if you don't then our support team will contact you using the phone number we have on file. If your trailer is stolen, you will likely need to file a stolen vehicle report with the police. We may, at your request, help you in communications with the relevant authorities. We have the renterâ€™s information on file and we will do everything reasonably in our power to help return your trailer. Any users that steal trailers will be banned from future use of the app. TrailerHub may sue for damages, according to our <a href='/termsofservicedoc.html' target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>. Criminal charges may be filed against the offending party.</p>

Please access your rental record from the app home page and select the "Something wrong?" button. From that page you can submit a "Dispute" where you can send us information about the problem you\'re experiencing. Please do not press the "Cancel" button at this time, since that will not refund you the whole payment amount. After you send the dispute message, please send our support team (Support@TrailerHub.io) an email with pictures that indicate what was wrong with the trailer. Feel free to call us to settle things faster, otherwise our support team will reach out to you via phone call shortly.'
